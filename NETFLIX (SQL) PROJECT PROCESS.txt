*** Advanced SQL Project | Netflix Data Analysis Using SQL ***
1.Download Datasets from KAGGLE using the link provided(download "ZIP" file).
2.Open it in the folder and unzip it and copy the file to desktop.
3.Create a DATABASE using this command: "create database netflix;" (refresh it if it is not visible)
4.Also write this command: "use netflix;" (so that it will be setup as base, which means whatever we perform now will reflect in it)

*** CREATE A TABLE NAMED NETFLIX ***
1.Open SSMS and run this command: "use netflix;" (so that it will be setup as base, which means whatever we perform now will reflect in it).
2.Create a Table using this command: 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
create table netflix
(
show_id      VARCHAR(5),
type         VARCHAR(10),
title        VARCHAR(250),
director     VARCHAR(550),
casts        VARCHAR(1050),
country      VARCHAR(550),
date_added   VARCHAR(55),
release_year INT,
rating       VARCHAR(15),
duration     VARCHAR(15),
listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
description  VARCHAR(550)
);
select * from netflix;
3.Import the data into this table, since we have 8,807 rows it is humanly impossible to import, so use data import method from ankit bansal sir channel.(after importing change your table name)
4.After importing just check using command: "select * from table_name;"
5.Check the Count to make sure the data entered is correct using this command: "select count(*) total_content from netflix;"
6.To check different TYPES(either movie or season, use this command: "select distinct type from netflix;"

*** 15 BUSINESS PROBLEMS ***
1.Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows:
select type,count(*) content_type_count from netflix group by type;

2.Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows
select type,rating from
(select type,rating,count(*) count_,rank() over(partition by type order by count(*) desc) ranking
from netflix group by type,rating)b where ranking=1;
																																																																																																																																		
3.List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)
select title from netflix where type='Movie' and release_year=2020;
select * from netflix where type='Movie' and release_year=2020;

4.Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix
Here we are using 2 different functions:
1. STRING TO ARRAY : STRING_TO_ARRAY(column_name,'delimeter')
2. UNNEST : UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(column_name,'delimeter')) UNNEST(ARRAY)

QUERY:(BOTH FUNCTIONS ARE POSTGRE SQL FUNCTIONS)
select unnest(string_to_array(country,',')) as new_country,count(*) from netflix
group by unnest(string_to_array(country,',')) order by count(*) desc limit 5;

select unnest(string_to_array(country,',')) as new_country,count(*) as total_content from netflix
group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 5;
(HERE 1 & 2 MEANS THE COLUMNS WHICH WE USED 1ST & 2ND AFTER SELECT CLAUSE)

5.Identify the Longest Movie
select * from netflix where type='movie' and duration=(select max(duration) from netflix);

6.Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years
select * from netflix where 
to_date(date_added,'Month DD,YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - Interval '5 Years';

7.Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka' (ilike is in case-sensitive where like is case-sensitive)
select * from netflix where director ilike '%Rajiv Chilaka%';

8.List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons (here we are using int because the result after split_part is string, we need to convert it to int)
SELECT * FROM netflix WHERE type = 'TV Show' AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT > 5;(if int won't works use "NUMERIC")

9.Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre
SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) AS genre,COUNT(*) AS total_content FROM netflix GROUP BY 1;

10.Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix.
select extract(year from to_date(date_Added,"month dd,yyyy')) as year,count(*) as yearly_count,
round(count(*)::numeric/(select count(*) from netflix where country="india')::numeric % 100,2) as average_content_per_year
from netflix where country='India' group by 1;

11.List All Movies that are Documentaries
select * from netflix where type='Movie' and listed_in like '%Documentaries%';

12.Find All Content Without a Director
select * from netflix where director is null;

13.Find How Many Movies Actor 'Salman Khan' Appeared in the Last 10 Years
select * from netflix where cast like '%Salman Khan%' AND release_year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10;

14.Find the Top 10 Actors Who Have Appeared in the Highest Number of Movies Produced in India
SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ',')) AS actor,COUNT(*) as total_content FROM netflix WHERE country like '%India%' GROUP BY actor ORDER BY total_content DESC LIMIT 10;

15.Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords  Categorize content as 'Bad' if it contains 'kill' or 'violence' and 'Good' otherwise. Count the number of items in each category.
with new_table as
(select *,case 
when description like '%kill%' or description like '%violence%' 
then 'Bad_content' else 'Good_content' end as category from netflix)
select category,count(*) total_content from new_table group by category;
